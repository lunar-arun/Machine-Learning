A time series is simply a set of data points ordered in time, 

the data is often equally spaced in time, meaning that equal intervals separate each data point.

Keep in mind that the y-axis represents the value, while the x-axis still refers to time.

Forecasting is predicting the future using historical data and knowledge of future events that might affect our forecasts.

Forecasting relies on historical data and statistical models to make predictions about future trends, while prediction relies on incomplete or uncertain information to make judgments about future events.

Four Components of Time Series:
Trend : The slow-moving changes in a time series.
        starts out flat and then steeply goes up, meaning that we have an increasing, or positive.

Seasonal or Cyclic : a cycle that occurs over a fixed period of time.

Irregular : Represent the behavior that cannot be explained by the trend and seasonality
components.

Naive Forecasting : Forecast for next period actual demand from the previous period 

Moving Average : A time series which does'nt show any trend. To deal with random variation
