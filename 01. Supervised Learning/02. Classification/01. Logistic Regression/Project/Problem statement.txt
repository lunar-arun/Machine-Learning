Vaccine Usage Prediction

Abstract:
    Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can combine data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in bioinformatics.


Problem Statement:
    Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

Scope:
●Exploratory data analysis
●Data Pre-processing
●Training logistic regression model with MLE for prediction
●Tuning the model to improve the performance


Learning Outcome:
    The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge about the data that we have and train Logistic Regression using MLE.
