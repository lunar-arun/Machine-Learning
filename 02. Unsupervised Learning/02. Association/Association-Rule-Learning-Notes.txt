Association rule learning is a technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable.

Association rule learning can be divided into three types of algorithms:
    1.Apriori
    2.Eclat
    3.F-P Growth Algorithm
    
Metrics are given below:
    1.Support
    2.Confidence
    3.Lift
